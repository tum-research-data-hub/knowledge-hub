# **Welcome to the Data Knowledge Hub!**

## **Cultivating Research Integrity and Reproducibility**

High-standard Research Data Management (RDM) is not just a compliance requirement, but a foundational skill set that ensures the long-term impact, traceability, and reproducibility of your work. The [**TUM Research Data Hub**](https://web.tum.de/en/researchdata/hub/), a collaboration between the [University Library](https://www.ub.tum.de/en) and the [Munich Data Science Institute (MDSI)](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/en/mdsi/home/), provides the expertise and infrastructure to support you through every stage of the research life cycle.

This **Knowledge Hub** offers a comprehensive ecosystem of resources focusing on:

### **1\. Central Point of Contact and Support**

* **Consulting and Data Stewards:** Benefit from expert know-how by requesting a dedicated Data Steward for project-related RDM support.  
* **Lifecycle Support:** Targeted information for all phases: from **Planning** (DMPs) and **Analysis** to **Archiving** and **Publication**.  
* **Training:** Programmes ranging from *RDM Essentials* to technical workshops and seminar on different softwares and tools.

### **2\. Infrastructure & Technical Solutions**

We recommend and support digital solutions tailored to the TUM environment:

* [**TUM DataTagger**](https://www.ub.tum.de/en/datatagger)**:** Central open-source tool for collaborative data annotation, versioning, and sharing.  
* [**TUM eLabFTW**](https://www.ub.tum.de/en/eln)**:** The official electronic lab notebook (ELN) for structured and secure documentation.  
* [**mediaTUM**](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/)**:** TUM’s institutional repository for publishing and archiving citable research data (DOIs).  
* **Storage Solutions:** Tiered options for "hot data" and archiving via the [Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ)](https://www.lrz.de/).

### **3\. Best Practice & Community Exchange**

* **TUM Guidelines:** Adhering to the *TUM Guidelines for Handling Research Data* to ensure transparency and sustainability.  
* **Network & Events:** Join the **NFDI Round Table** or **Industry Expert Talks** to share experiences and tackle data challenges with fellow researchers.  
* **Domain-Specific Support:** Tailored methodologies for specialised fields, particularly in data-intensive areas like Bioinformatics and Engineering.
