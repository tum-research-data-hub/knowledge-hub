# **Welcome to the TUM Data Knowledge Hub**

## **Cultivating Research Integrity and Reproducibility**

High-standard Research Data Management (RDM) is not just a compliance requirement, but a foundational skill set that ensures the long-term impact, traceability, and reproducibility of your work. The **TUM Research Data Hub**—a collaboration between the University Library and the Munich Data Science Institute (MDSI)—provides the expertise and infrastructure to support you through every stage of the research life cycle.

The Knowledge Hub offers a comprehensive ecosystem of resources focusing on:

### **1\. Central Point of Contact & Support**

* **Consulting & Data Stewards:** Benefit from expert know-how by requesting a dedicated Data Steward for project-related RDM support.  
* **Lifecycle Support:** Targeted information for all phases: from **Planning** (DMPs) and **Analysis** to **Archiving** and **Publication**.  
* **Training:** Programs ranging from *RDM Essentials* to technical seminars on *TUM DataTagger* and *eLabFTW*.

### **2\. Infrastructure & Technical Solutions**

We recommend and support digital solutions tailored to the TUM environment:

* [**TUM DataTagger**](https://web.tum.de/en/researchdata/infrastructure-tools/)**:** Central open-source tool for collaborative data annotation, versioning, and sharing.  
* [**TUM eLabFTW**](https://web.tum.de/en/researchdata/infrastructure-tools/)**:** The official electronic lab notebook (ELN) for structured and secure documentation.  
* [**mediaTUM**](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/)**:** TUM’s institutional repository for publishing and archiving citable research data (DOIs).  
* **Storage Solutions:** Tiered options for "hot data" and archiving via the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ).

### **3\. Best Practice & Community Exchange**

* **TUM Guidelines:** Adhering to the *TUM Guidelines for Handling Research Data* to ensure transparency and sustainability.  
* **Network & Events:** Join the **NFDI Round Table** or **Industry Expert Talks** to share experiences and tackle data challenges with fellow researchers.  
* **Domain-Specific Support:** Tailored methodologies for specialised fields, particularly in data-intensive areas like Bioinformatics and Engineering.
