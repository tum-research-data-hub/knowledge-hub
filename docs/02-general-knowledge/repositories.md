A **repository** is a structured digital platform for storing, documenting, preserving, and sharing research data or publications, ensuring they remain accessible, citable, and reusable over time.

Researchers can use registry services to search for trusted repositories by discipline, data type, certification status, or funder requirements, helping them identify an appropriate place to deposit their data.
